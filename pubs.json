            "abstract": "Considering recent contradictions in the literature concerning the influence of loss aversion on cheating behavior, I study the extant methodological differences using the die-roll paradigm while comparing two common methods for framing outcomes as losses: the ''Expected Value'' method relying on the ex-ante expected earnings from the experiment and the ''Money Manipulation'' method that differentiates between participants who start with a zero or non-zero endowment. I find no significant evidence that loss affects (dis)honesty in Expected Value framing, contrasting previous evidence from coin-toss experiments. However, I find evidence that loss decreases lying under Money Manipulation framing, consistent with existing die-roll literature and significantly differing from the results of the Expected Value framing method. I consider these differences in the context of defaults, trust, and possible detection limitations. Comparing these results to prior research, I argue that further replications and direct comparisons between experimental methods used to study cheating behavior are necessary for lending broader generalizability and applicability to the results of future cheating experiments."
