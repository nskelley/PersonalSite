                        <h1>Nicholas Skelley</h1>
                        <p>I am a predoctoral research associate at the MIT Sloan School of Management and J-PAL North America working for <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/joseph-doyle" target="_blank"><span>Joseph J. Doyle</span></a> on his research in health economics. As an undergraduate student at Emory University, I was heavily involved in research, working for <a href="https://economics.emory.edu/people/faculty/biography/oconnell-stephen.html" target="_blank"><span>Stephen D. O'Connell</span></a> in the Emory Economics Policy Lab (Fall 2020) and as an undergraduate research fellow (Summer 2021). I also completed an honors thesis under the advisement of <a href="https://economics.emory.edu/people/faculty/biography/lanier-kelli.html" target="_blank"><span>Kelli Lanier</span></a> (2021-2022). I have extensive experience programming in R and Stata and have done work in Python and a number of other languages.</p>

                    <p>Nicholas Skelley (2022). "Comparing experimental loss framing methods in a multi-leveled lying context." <span class="it">In preparation</span>.</p>

                    <h3 id="health-econ">Healthcare Interventions</h3>
                    <p>Since July of 2022, I have worked with Joseph J. Doyle, Jr. (Erwin H. Schell Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management) on his ongoing projects in health economics, including randomized controlled trials evaluating health outcomes under <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/es/node/2332157" target="_blank"><span>food-as-medicine programs</span></a> and the effectiveness of behavioral nudges at improving health and increasing vaccine uptake.</p>
                    <p>As part of this work, I have participated in meetings with external data and healthcare providers, including Quest Diagnostics and Geisinger Health Systems. I also got to complete the 2022 <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/page/information-affiliates#rst" target="_blank"><span>J-PAL North America Research Staff Training</span></a>, attending instruction on best code and project management practices, data security and encryption, power analysis, and a Q&amp;A session with <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/christopher-blattman" target="_blank"><span>Christopher Blattman</span></a> concerning his research on gang activity and rule in Colombia.</p>

                    <h3 id="loss-lying">Loss &amp; Lying</h3>
                    <p>During the 2021-2022 academic year, I worked under the advisement of Kelli Lanier (Associate Teaching Professor, Emory University) on my honors thesis, an experimental investigation of the methods used to study the intersection of loss aversion and lying behavior aimed at resolving conflicting findings in the extant literature. I am currently expanding and revising my thesis before submitting to a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

                    <h3 id="vasyr">Refugee Aid &amp; Social Programs</h3>
                    <p>I spent the Summer of 2021 working with Stephen D. O'Connell (Associate Professor, Emory University) on research, in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, on the effects of unconditional cash transfers and World Food Program's cash-for-food vouchers on child fostering and household composition. This research uses data from the UNHCR's <a href="https://ialebanon.unhcr.org/vasyr/#/" target="_blank"><span>Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees (VASyR)</span></a> and administrative data from Lebanon and exploits a sharp cutoff in UNHCR funding for households in its empirical strategy.</p>
                    <p>This work builds on Altindag and O'Connell's (2023) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2022.102942" target="_blank"><span>existing work</span></a> on unconditional cash transfers to Syrian refugees in Lebanon, and I presented our findings at the 2021 Emory Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium.</p>
