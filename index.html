                <h1>Nicholas Skelley</h1>
                <p>I am a senior at Emory University majoring in Economics with a minor in Math. In the past two years at Emory, I have been heavily involved in research, working as a research assistant in the Economics Policy Lab and as an undergraduate research fellow during the Summer of 2021. I have extensive experience coding in R, and I am currently working to develop my skills in Python, Stata, and SQL.</p>

                        <p>I have done most of my recent research work in R, and that is the statistical package I am most familiar with. I am also scheduled to learn Python and Stata during the Spring of 2022 so that I can seamlessly move between packages and projects. In addition to programming for statistics and research, I have previously written in Lua, Swift, Objective-C, C#, and Java, and I have worked in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL as part of my extracurricular interest in web development.</p>
                        <p>In my <a href="https://github.com/nskelley/Portfolio" target="_blank"><span>GitHub portfolio</span></a>, I show some of my work in R, including replicating results presented in peer-reviewed research (with publicly available data sets) and the code used to create tables and visualizations for the draft manuscript I wrote during the Summer of 2021.</p>
